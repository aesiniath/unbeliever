-- Ideally we'd just set up inotifies on these individual files, but that
-- doesn't work when programs like vim move the original file, save a new one,
-- then delete the renamed original.
--
-- From previous work we know that @CLOSE_WRITE@ is emitted reliably by inotify
-- on Linux through these sequences. We need to continue testing to assure
-- ourselves that the __fsnotify__ package's @Modify@ represents this
-- accurately.
