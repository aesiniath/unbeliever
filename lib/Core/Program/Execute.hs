Embelish a Haskell command-line program with useful behaviours.

/Runtime/

Sets number of capabilities (heavy-weight operating system threads used by
the GHC runtime to run Haskell green threads) to the number of CPU cores
available (for some reason the default is 1 capability only, which is a bit
silly on a multicore system).

Install signal handlers to properly terminate the program performing
cleanup as necessary.

/Logging and output/

The 'Program' monad provides functions for both normal output and debug
logging. A common annoyance when building command line tools and daemons is
getting program output to @stdout@ and debug messages interleaved, made
even worse when error messages written to @stderr@ land in the same
console. To avoid this, when all output is sent through a single channel.
This includes both normal output and log messages.

/Exceptions/

Ideally your code should handle (and not leak) exceptions, as is good
practice anywhere in the Haskell ecosystem. As a measure of last resort
however, if an exception is thrown (and not caught) by your program it will
be caught at the outer 'execute' entrypoint, logged for debugging, and then
your program will exit.

/Customizing the execution context/

The 'execute' function will run your 'Program' in a basic 'Context'
initialized with appropriate defaults. Most settings can be changed at
runtime, but to specify the allowed command-line options and expected
arguments you can initialize your program using 'configure' and then run
with 'executeWith'.

Write the supplied @Bytes@ to the given @Handle@. Note that in contrast to

Do not use this to output to @stdout@ as that would bypass the mechanism
used by the @write*@ functions to sequence output correctly. If you wish to
write to the terminal use:

blob you pass in is not UTF-8 text).

between threads
