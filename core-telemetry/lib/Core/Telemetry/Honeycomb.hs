{- |
A exporter backend that sends telemetry in the form of traces of your
application's behaviour, or event data—accompanied either way by [conceivably
very wide] additional metadata—to the Honeycomb observability service.

When specifying the 'honeycombExporter' you have to specify certain
command-line options and environment variables to enable it:

@
\$ __export HONEYCOMB_TEAM="62e3626a2cc34475adef4d799eca0407"__
\$ __burger-service --telemetry=honeycomb --dataset=prod-restaurant-001__
@

If you annotate your program with spans, you can get a trace like this:

![Example Trace](HoneycombTraceExample.png)

/Notice/

This library is Open Source but the Honeycomb service is /not/. Honeycomb
offers a free tier which is quite suitable for individual use and small local
applications. In the future you may be able to look at
"Core.Telemetry.General" if you instead want to forward to a generic
OpenTelemetry provider.
