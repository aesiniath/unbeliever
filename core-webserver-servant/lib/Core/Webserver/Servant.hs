Support integrating web services created by __servant__ with handlers defined
in the 'Program' monad. This is a thin wrapper which creates an 'Application'
which can be used with 'Core.Webserver.Warp.launchWebserver'.

@
import "Core.Program"
import "Core.Webserver.Servant"
import "Core.Webserver.Warp"

import MyServer (api, routes)

main :: 'IO' ()
main = do
    'Core.Program.Execute.execute' $ do
        application <- 'prepareRoutes' api routes
        'launchWebserver' 8080 application
@
-}
module Core.Webserver.Servant (
    prepareRoutes,
    prepareRoutesWithContext,
) where

import Control.Monad.Except (ExceptT (..))
import Core.Program
import Core.System (Exception (..))
import Core.Telemetry.Observability (clearMetrics)
import Core.Webserver.Warp
import Data.Proxy (Proxy)
import GHC.Base (Type)
import Network.Wai (Application)
import qualified Servant as Servant (
    Handler (..),
    ServerT,
 )
import qualified Servant.Server as Servant (
    Context (..),
    HasServer,
    ServerContext,
    serveWithContextT,
 )

data ContextNotFoundInRequest = ContextNotFoundInRequest deriving (Show)

instance Exception ContextNotFoundInRequest where
    displayException _ = "Context was not found in request. This is a serious error."

Convert a __servant__ API and set of handlers into a __warp__ 'Application'.

This 'Application' must be used with 'Core.Webserver.Warp.launchWebserver' so
that the necessary internal connections are made.

Usage is straight forward:

@
        application <- 'prepareRoutes' api routes
        'launchWebserver' 8080 application
@

This code creates an Application which has sufficient information to unlift
back to the 'Program' monad so that your handlers can be take advantage of the
logging and telemetry facilities of __core-program__ and __core-telemetry__.

Prepare routes as with 'prepareRoutes' above, but providing a __servant__
'Servant.Server.Context' in order to give detailed control of the setup.
